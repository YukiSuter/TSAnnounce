# TSAnnounce

Please note: This game is currently in pre-release. As such it may be buggy and may crash for no known reason. In this event, please send a report to me using the "issues" tab above and I'll do my best to solve it.

Some trains will not have door detection support for the "atStation" functionality. In this case, if you find it does not detect the doors being open, please open an issue with a title of "DOOR REQUEST: ADDON - TRAIN". If it is not a DLC and must be downloaded from another website, please link it in the issue description. I'll do my best to sort through these requests and sort them out.

## For installation and usage instructions, please view the Documentation that can be found in the release.
